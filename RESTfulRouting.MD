# RESTful Routing
Here I will have endpoints to integrate with this application,
as well as endpoints and notations for third party integration.

## Routes
/index
No Endpoints or data yet to dump.

# Third Party
Third Party Endpoints API

## Woocommerce SLMODD
We are using Express for API calls and endpoints.
<br>
`npm install express --save`

Created a server.js file and added it to the package.json
<br>
`"server": 'server.js'`

<strong>Here we will have our RESTful routing :)</strong>
