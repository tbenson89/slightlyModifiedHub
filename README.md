# Slightly Modified

THe main gateway applications to all things SLMODD this will extend via API using Oracles to speak to and from the blockchain via smart contracts --- Coming SOON! 

## We have some big BIG features coming to and around this platform. 

I am putting together the complete layout blueprint of how everyting is going to come together but stay tuned -- TUNED! 

## Important
- Add what the project is fully about
- what you still need to do
- what the plan of the project is
- use cases of the project

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Nodemon

I have installed Nodemon so you do not have to save and refresh and rebuild the project after changes. 
Just Type nodemon in the project DIR in Command Line and the server will stay running.

If you want to add this to your project  [npm](https://npm.com) `npm install nodemon --save`
