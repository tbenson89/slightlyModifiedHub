# Slightly Modified

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.20.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Nodemon

I have installed Nodemon so you do not have to save and refresh and rebuild the project after changes. 
Just Type nodemon in the project DIR in Command Line and the server will stay running.

If you want to add this to your project  [npm](https://npm.com) `npm install nodemon --save`

 
## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
